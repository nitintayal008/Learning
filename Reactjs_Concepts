useMemo hook we used to memoize the value as a cache and by doinf so we can improve the code efficiency of our project

-> Higher-order function that accepts a function func as its parameter. 
In JavaScript, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function.

const tryCatchHandler = (func) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    // ...
  };
};

const tryCatchHandler = (func) => (req, res, next) => {
  // ...
};
they both have the same behavior
